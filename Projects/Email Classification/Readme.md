# Email Classification: Ham or Spam

This repository provides a Python implementation for classifying emails as either "ham" (not spam) or "spam" using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features, making it suitable for text classification tasks.

## Overview

The Naive Bayes algorithm is effective for classifying text data by leveraging word frequencies and probabilistic reasoning. This implementation includes steps for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and standardize email text data by removing noise and irrelevant characters.
- **Feature Extraction**: Convert text data into numerical features using techniques such as Bag of Words or TF-IDF.
- **Model Training**: Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the processed data.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
