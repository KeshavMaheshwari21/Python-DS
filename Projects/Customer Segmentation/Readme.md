# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Customer Segmentation project. The objective of this project is to classify customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project has the following columns:

1. **`CustomerID`**: Unique identifier for each customer.
2. **`Genre`**: Gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
3. **`Age`**: Age of the customer.
4. **`Annual Income (k$)`**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
5. **`Spending Score (1-100)`**: Spending score assigned to the customer, ranging from 1 to 100 based on purchasing behavior.
