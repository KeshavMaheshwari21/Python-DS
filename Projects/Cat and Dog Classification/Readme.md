# Dog and Cat Classification using CNN

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of dog and cat images to distinguish between the two classes with high accuracy.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- opencv-python (optional, for image preprocessing)
