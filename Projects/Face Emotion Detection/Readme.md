# Face Emotion Detection

This project implements real-time facial emotion detection using a pre-trained deep learning model and OpenCV. The system detects faces from live webcam footage and classifies emotions like happy, sad, angry, etc., based on the detected face.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade.
- Emotion prediction using a deep learning model trained on facial emotion datasets.
- Displays the detected emotion on the live feed.
- Supports classification of seven emotions: `Angry`, `Disgust`, `Fear`, `Happy`, `Sad`, `Surprise`, `Neutral`.
