# Flight Price Prediction Model

This project implements a flight price prediction model using a Random Forest Regressor. The model predicts flight prices based on several input features including airline, source city, departure time, stops, arrival time, destination city, class, duration, and days left.

Each feature seems to represent different aspects of a flight, such as:
- duration: Flight duration
- days_left: Days left until the flight
- price: Price of the flight
- airline_*: Different airlines
- source_city_*: Different source cities
- departure_time_*: Different times of departure
- stops_*: Number of stops
- arrival_time_*: Different times of arrival
- destination_city_*: Different destination cities
- class_Business: Indicates whether the flight is business class
