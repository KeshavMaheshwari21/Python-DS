# Cancer Detection 

## Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for cancer detection using Logistic Regression. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. The model is trained to classify cancerous (Malignant) and non-cancerous (Benign) cases based on features extracted from a dataset.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
