# Bike Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting bike prices using a linear regression model. The model estimates the price of a bike based on features such as bike name, city, kilometers driven, owner, age, and power.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- `bike name` - The name or model of the bike.
- `price` - The price of the bike (target variable).
- `city` - The city where the bike is being sold.
- `kms driven` - The total kilometers driven by the bike.
- `owner` - The number of previous owners of the bike.
- `age` - The age of the bike in years.
- `power` - The power of the bike in horsepower.
