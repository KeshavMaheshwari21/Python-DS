# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project is a simple real-time face detection system using Python and OpenCV. It captures video from your webcam and detects faces in each frame using a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier. Detected faces are marked with green rectangles.

## Features
- **Real-time video capture**: Captures video from the webcam.
- **Face detection**: Detects faces using Haar Cascade Classifier.
- **Live display**: Faces are highlighted with green rectangles in the video feed.
- **Exit with 'a' key**: Press the 'a' key to stop the video stream.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2` module)

### Installation

1. Install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the OpenCV library by running:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
